        Turbulence. It feels quiet now, but I suspect we are still at its whim.

    <p>
        Things are falling apart. Disagreements over the nature of nature and thus also with the
        direction the project should take. Legal inquiries are made into the possibility of retracting one’s contributions to the work. There’s the whole problem of nature thinking about itself through us, that the nature of nature is always from one angle at a time.

    <p>
        Part of the team is still onboard, patching together fragments of materials to shape a container that could provide some sort of makeshift shelter, of hope, for us, but also for others to come.

    <p>
        The other part of the team has spun out of reach, telecommunication has come to a standstill. We are each alone in our remote outposts.

    <p>
        But the clouds are still passing, and the sound of an endless stream of vehicles is still there too. The gentle movement of the leaves in the wind is soothing. As I let my defenses down, I start to feel the warmth of sadness, and my mind drifts. I like looking at the clouds, through glass or on glass. Who doesn’t?

    <p>
        If things do keep falling apart, and I mean, properly apart, then how, I wonder, will our children’s children’s children know what it felt like when things were not apart. What would pictures mean to them, if they had never stood on a beach and felt the waves lap at their feet? What good would moving images be if these images only seem to reference themselves?

    <p>
        So we set out to capture the world not only as congealed moments in time, or of time, but also as sets of relations that could maybe some day be reactivated.

        Voice 1: Message in bottle, that’s one of the old ways of putting it. But there’s no bottle and no sea. Or, not for long anyway.
        Data caches are being sent out as far as possible, corralled by drones but who knows if they will be found, or heard, or understood.
    <p>[Strange sounds]
    <p>
        Voice 1: This is not a personal log. I’m looking over data flowing in from multiple sources...beacons, relays, the few observation posts that are still operational.

    <p>
        Decoherence. Everything is crumbling down to its ingredients, its base, its fundamentals. We, me and the drone, found something peculiar recently. There was a large comet passing through our sector and lodged in its mass was a derelict vessel. It almost passed without notice, the metal hulk was hidden by the effluvium of the comet’s tail
    <p>
        Voice 1: The drone saw it as a source of fuel so it pulled it out automatically to consume it. But then the dead vessel came to life and chased the probe. Then, as it neared it, it slowly, somehow, drained its power. But then the drone died and the derelict vessel just floated by its side, never moving again.
        [sounds or music here?]
    <p>
        Voice 1: I’m waiting for more signals. Messages in a bottle. But if I catch them out in the void, are they proof of something, of something that still exists? Evidence, a record, an archive? If the records are found, and the things they recorded are found, maybe this re-enchants them both, makes them worth saving, bringing on board, even as the ocean itself falls apart. The record of the thing, beside the thing, as a third thing.
        The ship is still there, and at times, I still pick up its signals. But they are faint like it’s only talking to the drone that has now long since died itself, keeping it company.
        I still listen to the signal from time to time. Here, listen.

        Voice 2: Pings and pulses from a planet that some time ago we thought might be habitable. The first science team, all dead by now, started calling it ripple. The globe was almost entirely ocean but it was a dead one, no life. There seemed to be so much potential for life there but it’s only a tomb.
        So many fossils, expired bits of life, the whole planet is a container for the dead. But we were told to leave the drone there circling forever in orbit. Or, not forever, till its power cells fail to drink up enough solar radiation to keep it from succumbing to the gravity well.
        [sounds]
    <p>
        What is to be learned from the congealed bits of life now hardened into rock? The history of the planet, the history of life on the planet, the history of non-life, the history of the planet in its solar system...its just levels of compact exhaustion at this point.
        The world is a quiet world. Perhaps this message will itself deteriorate before it is heard, or read, or seen, or detected. This archive contains troves of data about lost forms of turbulence and other material contingencies which have become increasingly rare as the universe clocks down towards total entropy. Or, that’s my guess anyway.
        Tracking smaller and smaller movements here, sometimes out of boredom. My monkey brain, or my rational brain, wants to see every motion as a cause, with a direction, with an agent behind it. Many hands moving all the puzzle pieces of the planet around to make things make sense. But it’s just sand shifting in a pile but spread across multiple mediums: rock, water, sand, flesh, storm gusts, all forms of turbulence.
        Some are gentle, almost distracting, others are cataclysmic but leave little trace in memory, they erase the traces of their happening, and of other existences with it.

        Voice 3: Oh, I’m out of injections. She’s trying to lull me to sleep with her electromagnetic hum but I’m still awake, still here.

        Computer Voice: Warning. Thermal Shield Fracturing detected.

        Voice 3: Closer and closer.

        Computer voice: Thermal limit exceeded. Sensor shielding failure.

        [Strange sounds]
    <p>
        Voice 3: Why send reports, can’t even cut through the EM radiation, skipping off the atmosphere, through the particle barrage. The colors must be beautiful if the planet was liveable. Maybe some other poor sentinel is watching from down there, stranded, listening to the same songs as me….wondering what the show would be like without that pesky atmosphere in the way.

        [more strange sounds]

        Voice 3: It’s still a burning, an always incomplete burning. Some soot and ash for future stars.
        Computer Voice: Warning, systems critical. Navigation module failing. Stabilization procedure disrupted. Core overload detected.
    <p>
        Voice 3: What if this doesn’t go anywhere. It will just be part of the solar outcast, an odd fluctuation on what will be presumed to be background noise.

    <p>
        Voice 4: Patterns, intelligent patterns? Someone lost in the cloud, or is it the cloud itself?
    <p>
        There's been a few reports of non-corporeal life forms....complex energy patterns that exhibit agency, higher order intelligence. As if we had good definitions of those things yet. Yet, if not by now then when?
        Or the whole nebulous thing could be alive...novel chemical reactions from the leftovers of collapsed stars leading to some self augmenting system. Stable pockets of energy conservation...who cares if it’s in a meat-sack as long as it keeps itself going.
        But maybe it's just random, bits of plasma filaments igniting and we idiots think it's a neuron the size of a whale. I miss whales.
    <p>
        The cloud is slow like them, like much sea life, or maybe more like a jelly fish....a ballooning life. But it's a preview of the end’s end, - collapse, explosion, diffusion.
        The AGI living with me (if that’s living) is convinced it’s an artificial life form taking refuge in the remnant, hiding from the dark forest of organic life...waiting for this wet breathing carnival to pass into the past. Maybe non-biological life will find a loophole out of this return to the elements.
    <p>
        A pocket universe, a time machine, a dimensional jump?
    <p>
        But none of that....we thinned out our supplies too quickly....maybe our biological systems are… too fragile anyway.
    <p>
        Computer Voice: Proximity alert. Unidentified vessel approaching.
