                In a hopefully distant future in which nothing of what surrounds us remains, not even the elements, troves of data containing code and text about lost forms of turbulence are recovered and presented to the audience via video projections and headsets.

                    <i>If things do keep falling apart, and I mean, properly apart, then how, I wonder, will our children’s children’s children know what it felt like when things were not apart? What would pictures mean to them, if they had never stood on a beach and felt the waves lap at their feet? What good would moving images be if these images only seem to reference themselves?</i>

                    Ebbs, flows and other forms of turbulence are protagonists here. Peripheral movement phenomena such as clouds, waves, wind, fog and smoke play a crucial role in immersive art forms such as anime and video games. They are the vehicles that transport us into imaginary realms. Artists have come up with a plethora of ways of simulating them, drawing on, but also pushing forward, developments in technology and science. Though often rooted in scientific modeling, they care only about illusion, balancing precision and computing time, doing just enough to call forth familiar sensations in otherworldly spaces.

                    Both magical and deeply melancholic, what do these interventions reveal about our modes of inhabiting the world?

                <p> The work includes excerpts of the following beautiful works from ShaderToy, an online community and tool for creating and sharing shaders. Shaders are programs executed by the GPU, and which make use of its parallel processing capacity for real time graphics.</p>
