                    If things do keep falling apart, and I mean, properly apart, then how, I wonder, will our children’s children’s children know what it felt like when things were not apart? What would pictures mean to them, if they had never stood on a beach and felt the waves lap at their feet? What good would moving images be if these images only seem to reference themselves?
                </p>
                <p>
                    So we set out to capture the world not only as congealed moments in time, or of time, but also as sets of relations that could maybe some day be reactivated, in real time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ebbs, flows and other forms of turbulence are protagonists here. Peripheral movement phenomena such as clouds, waves, wind, fog and smoke play a crucial role in immersive art forms such as anime and video games. They are the vehicles that transport us into imaginary realms. Artists have come up with a plethora of ways of simulating them, drawing on, but also pushing forward, developments in technology and science. Though often rooted in scientific modeling, they care only about illusion, balancing precision and computing time, doing just enough to call forth familiar sensations in otherworldly spaces.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Both magical and deeply melancholic, what do these interventions reveal about our modes of inhabiting the world?
